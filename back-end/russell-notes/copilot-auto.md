To configure GitHub Copilot CLI so that it can always run commands like `npm i` and `npm run test` without asking for confirmation, you need to set up the CLI to execute commands automatically. Here’s how you can achieve this:

### Steps to Allow Automatic Command Execution

1. **Install GitHub Copilot CLI**:
Make sure you have the Copilot CLI installed globally using the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @githubnext/github-copilot-cli
```

This will add the `github-copilot-cli` command to your PATH[^1][^7].
2. **Authenticate GitHub Copilot CLI**:
Run the authentication command to link your CLI with your GitHub account:

```bash
github-copilot-cli auth
```

Follow the instructions provided during authentication[^1][^5].
3. **Set Up Command Execution Alias**:
To allow Copilot CLI to execute commands directly, you need to configure the `ghcs` alias. This enables automatic execution of commands without manual confirmation. Run:

```bash
eval "$(github-copilot-cli alias -- "$0")"
```

Add this command to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, or equivalent) for persistent setup[^1][^7].
4. **Configure Command Suggestions**:
When using GitHub Copilot CLI, you can request command suggestions with:

```bash
gh copilot suggest "npm i &amp;&amp; npm run test"
```

To execute these commands automatically, select the **Execute command** option during the interactive session[^7].
5. **Automate Specific Commands**:
If you want Copilot to always run specific commands (e.g., `npm i` and `npm run test`) without asking, you may need to create a script or alias that invokes these commands directly via Copilot CLI.

### Example Script for Automation

You can create a script that uses Copilot CLI to always execute these commands:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
github-copilot-cli suggest "npm i &amp;&amp; npm run test" --execute
```

Save this script and make it executable (`chmod +x script.sh`). Run it whenever you want Copilot to handle these tasks automatically.

By setting up these configurations, GitHub Copilot CLI will be able to execute commands like `npm i` and `npm run test` seamlessly without requiring manual input each time[^7].
